## Launching a warp-speed Eleventy starter

v1.0.0 plants the flag for Subspace Builder: a batteries-included Eleventy 3 starter designed for fast, opinionated publishing without sacrificing flexibility. We tuned it for accessibility, clarity, and a Tachyons-powered design system you can remix in minutes.

Here is how it looks.

## What ships in v1.0.0

- Eleventy 3 with Markdown-it, automatic heading anchors, and the navigation plugin baked in for rich content collections.
- Tachyons utility classes and a theme-aware typographic scale out of the box.
- Responsive layouts that adapt from one-column to sidebar navigation without losing context.
- A reusable post list macro that trims excerpts sensibly and keeps your archive tidy.
- A modern OG image generator that renders branded cards from your Markdown.

## Theme previews at your fingertips

Theme switching is data-driven: `_data/themes.yaml` powers the options, and the layout scripts sync your choice across tabs while persisting it in `localStorage`. Hover previews and keyboard focus use the same system, so you can showcase skins like “Sun,” “Mint,” or “Midnight” before committing. Midtone accent colors even adjust headline flourishes automatically.

## Navigation built for growth

The `home.njk` layout wires up Eleventy Navigation to build recursive menus and wraps it in accessible markup. On narrow viewports, a hamburger toggle animates the sidebar while keeping focus states intact. Coupled with the Tachyons palette, the nav scales as your content tree grows without manual tweaking.

## Authoring that stays out of the way

Content creators write Markdown and let filters do the rest. The custom `excerpt` helper pulls the first paragraphs or falls back to smartly trimmed text, while front matter defaults in `posts/posts.json` ensure every post inherits the same layout. Need to highlight a collection? Import `renderPostList` and the template takes care of formatting.

## Automated sharing assets

`npx @11ty/eleventy` now triggers `generate-og-images.js` before every build. The script walks your posts, parses front matter with `gray-matter`, and renders high-contrast cards via Satori and Resvg. Cached manifests keep repeated builds fast, and you get production-ready images in `assets/og/` with no manual design work.

## Getting started

You can ship the starter as-is or tailor it to your brand in an afternoon.

```bash
npm install
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

Visit `http://localhost:8080`, cycle through the theme previews, and start editing the Markdown in `posts/`. When you are ready to push to production, run:

```bash
npx @11ty/eleventy
```

Deploy the `_site/` output to your favourite static host and you’re live.

## Looking ahead

v1.0.0 is a stable foundation, and we’re already exploring additional themes, image optimisations, and richer content macros. Try it out, let us know what you build, and help shape the next release.
